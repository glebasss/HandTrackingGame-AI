# AI Hand-Tracking Game: Laser and Finger Dot Controls 🎮🤖

Welcome to my **first AI-powered hand-tracking game** project! In this game, players can interact using their **hands**, either through **laser beams** or **finger dots**, to catch falling objects and score points. This project is my introduction to combining **AI hand tracking** with **game development**, and I’m excited to share it with you all!

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project leverages **MediaPipe** for hand detection and **OpenCV** for video processing, creating a unique interaction where players can control the game using their **hand gestures**. The gameplay includes:
- **Laser Mode**: Control a virtual laser beam between your fingers to interact with game objects.
- **Finger Dot Mode**: Use your fingertip to catch falling objects.

## 💡 **Features**
- **AI Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe to track hand landmarks in real-time.
- **Two Interaction Modes**:
  - **Laser Mode**: Lasers are drawn between two hand points, allowing you to "shoot" at objects.
  - **Finger Dot Mode**: Use specific fingertips to control interactions and catch the falling balls.
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Simple and fun gameplay, controlled entirely through hand gestures without the need for any external controllers.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.7+**
- **MediaPipe** for hand detection and tracking.
- **OpenCV** for capturing and processing video.
- **NumPy** for calculations.
- **Game Design** using basic Python classes and object-oriented programming.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Project**
